# Tic Tac Toe Game
## Project Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python. It allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 board. The game checks for a winner or a tie after each move and displays the result accordingly.

## Features
Two-player mode (Player X and Player O)

Real-time board updates after each move

Input validation to prevent overwriting cells

Win and tie detection

Clear and user-friendly interface in the terminal

## How to Play
Run the script using python tic_tac_toe.py.

Players take turns entering numbers (1â€“9) to choose a position on the board.

The game ends when a player wins or when the board is full (tie).
