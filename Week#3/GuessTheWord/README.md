# Guess the Word Game 🕵️‍♂️

## Project Overview
This is a simple command-line word guessing game built with Python. Inspired by traditional word games like Hangman, the player attempts to guess a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of trials.

This project was developed as part of Week 3 of the Zero-Grad Bootcamp.
