# Zero-Grad Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my Zero-Grad Bootcamp repository!  
This repo contains all the hands-on projects and assignments I've completed during the bootcamp, organized by week. Each project is designed to apply core programming concepts including control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and real-world applications like web scraping.
