## üîç Features & Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values (`NaN`) and negative values.
   - Extract `year`, `month`, `month_year`, and `season`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend analysis for cumulative cases and deaths over time.
   - Top 10 countries by cumulative cases in 2024.
   - Seasonal and regional analysis using WHO regions.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Line plots for cumulative cases and deaths.
   - Bar plots for seasonal totals by region.
   - Choropleth map for cumulative cases worldwide.
   - Histograms for monthly trends and estimated recoveries.

4. **Custom Functions**
   - `cumulative_cases_country(df, country, Xaxis)`: Plot cumulative cases for a specific country.
   - `cumulative_deaths_country(df, country, Xaxis)`: Plot cumulative deaths for a specific country.

## üìä Insights

- Cases and deaths increase over time, with peaks in Winter and Spring.  
- Top countries (USA, India, Brazil) account for the majority of global cases.  
- Most cases are concentrated in Americas, Europe, and parts of Asia.  
- Seasonal patterns are noticeable, with Winter/Spring having higher cases and deaths.  
- Estimated recoveries are increasing, though not official data.
